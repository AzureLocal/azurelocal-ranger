# Project Status

## Current Release Track — v1.4.2

AzureLocalRanger v1.4.2 is the current release — fully field-validated against a live tplabs-clus01 cluster via Operation TRAILHEAD (8-phase P0-P7 cycle). It delivers handoff-quality HTML reports with type-aware table rendering, improved SVG and draw.io diagram output, PDF cover pages, and WAF Assessment integration with an external rule engine.

## Operation TRAILHEAD

Field validation is structured as **Operation TRAILHEAD** — an eight-phase test cycle covering preflight, authentication, connectivity, individual collectors, data quality, reporting, and end-to-end scenarios. The gate issue remains the milestone-close checkpoint.
