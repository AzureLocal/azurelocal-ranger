# Project Status

## Current Release Track — v2.1.0

AzureLocalRanger v2.1.0 — Preflight Hardening — is the current release. It closes the three auth / preflight gaps identified against v2.0.0 so RBAC and credential problems surface up-front instead of mid-run: per-resource-type ARM probe for the v2.0.0 collector surfaces (#235), deep WinRM CIM probe against `root/MSCluster` / `root/virtualization/v2` / `root/Microsoft/Windows/Storage` via a new `Invoke-RangerCimDepthProbe` helper (#234), and an Azure Advisor read probe that downgrades to `Partial` on 403 with explicit `Microsoft.Advisor/recommendations/read` remediation (#233). All three probes are skipped in fixture mode. v2.0.0 — Extended Collectors & WAF Intelligence — remains the previous release.

## Previous Release — v2.0.0 — Extended Collectors & WAF Intelligence

AzureLocalRanger v2.0.0 — Extended Collectors & WAF Intelligence — lands seven new Arc-surface collectors (per-node extensions, logical networks + subnets, storage paths, custom locations, Arc Resource Bridge, Arc Gateway, marketplace + custom images), Azure Hybrid Benefit cost and savings analysis with dated pricing footer, VM distribution balance via coefficient-of-variation, Arc agent + OS version grouping with drift detection, weighted WAF scoring (rule weight 1–3 + warning-as-half-weight + score thresholds), hot-swap WAF config via `Export-RangerWafConfig` / `Import-RangerWafConfig`, a `json-evidence` raw-inventory output format, concurrent-collection and empty-data reliability guards, automatic required-module install/update on startup, portrait/landscape PDF switching, and conditional status-cell coloring across all tables.

## Previous Release — v1.6.0 — Platform Intelligence

AzureLocalRanger v1.6.0 — Platform Intelligence — lands auto-discovery of resource group and cluster FQDN (from Azure Arc and from on-prem TrustedHosts / DNS fallbacks), a multi-method Azure auth chain (service-principal-cert, tenant-matching context reuse, sovereign-cloud), a dedicated pre-run permission audit (`Test-RangerPermissions` with `-SkipPreCheck` opt-out), cross-RG node fallback, Azure Resource Graph single-query discovery, graceful degradation on partial Azure permissions, file-based progress IPC for background runspaces, high-fidelity PDF rendering via headless Edge, DOCX OOXML tables, XLSX formula-injection safety, a Power BI CSV + star-schema export, and graduated WAF threshold scoring.

## Operation TRAILHEAD

Field validation is structured as **Operation TRAILHEAD** — an eight-phase test cycle covering preflight, authentication, connectivity, individual collectors, data quality, reporting, and end-to-end scenarios. The gate issue remains the milestone-close checkpoint.

## Roadmap

See the [Roadmap](roadmap.md) for post-v1 work, including PowerPoint output, firewall collector expansion, and richer operator experiences.
